# prjkt

Project scaffolding made easy!

<hr>

## Motivation
Heavily Inspired by [degit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/degit). I liked the concept of it and what it had for plan. But by looking at repo it seems there's no development going on with it so i decided to make this while learning go.

[See this issue for the progress](https://github.com/patheticGeek/prjkt/issues/1)

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/patheticGeek/prjkt.git
```
2. Install
```bash
go install .
```
3. Test if it's working with
```bash
prjkt help
```

## Usage:

Basic usage:
```bash
prjkt c -u https://github.com/patheticGeek/pg-nextjs-boilerplate
```
This will clone and remove git from the project

More options for create command:
```bash
prjkt help create
```
