# prjkt

Project scaffolding made easy!

## Motivation
Heavily Inspired by [degit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/degit). I liked the concept of it and what it had for plan. But by looking at repo it seems there's no development going on with it so i decided to make this while learning go.

[See this issue for the progress](https://github.com/patheticGeek/prjkt/issues/1)
